Even though the native methods have worse names (forEach, every, some),
since this library is trying to smooth over the native language it makes
more sense to use the native names, and provide aliases for more sensible
names from other languages, not the other way around.

Note this doesn't change any external usage, it just makes more sense.

This should also be useful for abstraction purposes for building underscore
functions, something like:

  addFn('some', {has_native: true, our_version: function () {...}})

this way we could feature detect on load for native versions and build a
function, and also have the option to turn off native versions for testing
our implementation.

    jam publish -f

`javaOptions` array, which could occur prior to the invocation of the Closure

`getJavaOptions` function, which passes the `javaOptions` array to a callback.

`getJavaOptions` is defined lazily; after the first invocation, the options
are cached and passed to all subsequent callbacks. The callbacks are invoked
on the next tick for compatibility with `exec`.

* Fixing default transformRequest of TypedArrays with buffer pools

A buffer pool is a large ArrayBuffer of a preset size used with a TypedArray
such as Uint8Array. This can speed up performance when constructing TypedArrays
of unknown sizes, and is a technique used by Node with their Buffers, and
by libraries like dcodeIO/protobuf.js.

Because the ArrayBuffer of such a TypedArray is much longer than the array
itself, using `.buffer` to transform the array before POSTing results in
sending a request with many extraneous empty bytes, which is wastefule and may
result in unexpected behavior.

Using `.slice()` before grabbing the ArrayBuffer fixes the problem by creating
a new TypedArray with a buffer of the expected length.

* Adding test for using default transformRequest with buffer pools

Adds a new test to the default transformRequest, running it on a
Uint8Array with a byte length of 16, but a much larger ArrayBuffer
with a byte length of 256. The transformed array should not include
any extra bytes, and so must have a byte length of just 16.

Small change to the data attribute doc of the config. A request body can also be set for DELETE methods but this wasn't mentioned in the documentation (it only mentioned POST, PUT and PATCH). Took my some 10-20 minutes until I realized that I don't need to manipulate the request body with transformRequest in the case of DELETE.

According to the ESLint release note http://eslint.org/blog/2015/11/eslint-v1.10.0-released#configuration-file-formats):

> We are formally deprecating use of the `.eslintrc` extensionless configuration file format in favor the format-specific versions. Don't worry, we'll still support `.eslintrc` files for a long time, but we'd like to encourage everyone to move to the new file formats as you'll get advantages such as syntax highlighting and error detection with many editors.

Actually, Github doesn't highlight `.eslintrc` contents, but does well for `.eslintrc.yml`.

* use parent extension instead of fromHtml flag

* create WasmAsset

* RustAsset refactor
 get rid of wargo
 use wasm32-unknown-unknown

* fix lint errors, remove toml package and delete jsconfig.json

* Inline wasm into JS, instantiate, and return exports

* Split bundle loaders into separate modules

Register custom loaders with `bundler.addBundleLoader`

* Split out build queue logic into its own class

Enables `bundler.getAsset` method to resolve and process an asset at any time, outside of the normal asset tree construction.

* Only add a single asset to bundle if raw packager is used

This gives us a separate bundle for each output file.

* Include used bundle loaders, and preload external modules

Allows synchronous import to preload modules in external files, e.g. .wasm file, prior to execution of the JS bundle.

Also processes the HMR runtime like other assets.

* Register wasm loader

* Replace dedicated WASMAsset with RawAsset

No longer returns a URL to the JS bundle if there is a bundle loader defined. This will cause the asset to be preloaded prior to JS bundle execution.

* Update tests

* Clean up bundling code

* Hopefully fix test in travis

* wasm tests

* Define correct wasm mime type

Until https://github.com/pillarjs/send/pull/154 is merged.

* Use WebAssembly.instantiate instead of constructor

An alternative to #1817 that doesn't rely on using `graphql-tag/loader`, which is a Webpack loader.

#### What this does:
1. Recursively traverse the GraphQL files.
2. Collect all the imports into a map.
3. Concatenate them.
4. Parse the result into an AST.

#### What this doesn't do:

This PR (as of time of writing) does not have feature parity with `graphql-tag/loader`, meaning that:
* It does not de-duplicate fragments that have the same name. _This is a behavior that I personally disapprove of since it can lead to surprising results instead of throwing an error if a user accidentally (however unlikely) reuses an already defined fragment name._
* It does not collect multiple defined queries/mutations and make them individually require-able from a JavaScript parent.

I understand that Parcel should watch changes every time the watch command is being used.
Previously, watch was enabled on dev environment only, while the watch command inserted by users was completely ignored.

With this modification, watch is always enabled if the user passes the command in CLI.

---
name: Add test to fs.readFileSync in TypeScript files
---
```
parcel-bundler version 1.9.7
```

## 💥 Problem

Inlining file in browser mode doesn't work in TypeScript files when `fs` is imported with star import or default import. The only way to use `readFileSync` is:
```typescript
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
const raw = readFileSync(__dirname + '/raw.tsx', 'utf-8');
```

### Reproduction: 
Repo: https://github.com/hasparus/parcel-readfilesync-typescript-repro
ghPages: https://hasparus.github.io/parcel-readfilesync-typescript-repro/
CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/github/hasparus/parcel-readfilesync-typescript-repro/tree/master/

Fun Fact: All ways to import `fs` work on CodeSandbox (parcel template).

## ↪️ Pull Request
Adds test to `fs.readFileSync` in TypeScript files and thus provides better workaround for #1736.

Changed the logic to determine which package manager to use during auto-installation.

The only situation Parcel should use yarn is when it satisfies
- There is `yarn` command available
AND
- There is `yarn.lock` file
AND
- There is NOT `package-lock.json`

Otherwise, it uses npm.

Fixes #2117 

## 🚨 Test instructions

<!-- In case it is impossible (or too hard) to reliably test this feature/fix with unit tests, please provide test instructions! -->

Setup a testing directory with different setups (package-lock existence, yarn.lock existence, yarn command existence).
The only situation Parcel should use yarn is when
- There is `yarn` command available
AND
- There is `yarn.lock` file
AND
- There is NOT `package-lock.json`

## ✔️ PR Todo

~~- [ ] Added/updated unit tests for this change~~
- [x] Filled out test instructions (In case there aren't any unit tests)
- [x] Included links to related issues/PRs

## Side note

There is a situation where there are both package-lock.json and yarn.lock. Having npm as default package manager means that it should use npm in this situation.

That's why there is only one situation where Parcel should use yarn.",hoishinxii+github@gmail.com,jasperdemoor@gmail.com,2018-10-11 18:07:43+09:00,2018-10-11 11:07:43+02:00,0.0,0.0,0.0,44,158,186,33,126,152,11,32,34,5,1,12,17,2333,3.8,14.3,741,0.0

* Defer throwing asset errors until after dependencies are handled.

This allows compiled langauges like Elm that handle their own dependency
compilation to set up watchers for dependencies so that hot-reload
continues to work due to errors in new depdenencies. Fixes #2147.

* Fix Elm error generation.

I'm not entirely sure why this fix is necessary, but without it a
compile error during a rebuild results in Parcel printing ""Unknown
error"" instead of anything useful. Since we are intecepting the error
though, we can also remove redundant stack information.

* Add test for tracking dependencies on error

* revert hmr-runtime changes

* Transform all errors in Pipeline.process.

This prevents error data from being lost when Pipeline is run via

Notably, this bans `any`, `Object`, `Function` and other unsound types. I started with `@parcel/types` by extracting unsafe types (those that are or include `any`) into `unsafe.js`, which will remain out of strict mode while we further refine our types.

This sets violations of the `no-return-await` to `error`. `return await` is redundant as values returned from an async function are effectively wrapped in a `Promise.resolve`, and awaiting another promise in addition to this will defer resolution another microtick.

[eslint is good enough to detect the valid use case of `return await` in a `try`/`catch`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-return-await). We also get clever with a short circuiting `||` in `Resolver` so I disabled it there, but we should probably rewrite it to be clearer in the future.

This sets violations of the `no-return-await` to `error`. `return await` is redundant as values returned from an async function are effectively wrapped in a `Promise.resolve`, and awaiting another promise in addition to this will defer resolution another microtick.

[eslint is good enough to detect the valid use case of `return await` in a `try`/`catch`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-return-await). We also get clever with a short circuiting `||` in `Resolver` so I disabled it there, but we should probably rewrite it to be clearer in the future.

* Defer throwing asset errors until after dependencies are handled.

This allows compiled langauges like Elm that handle their own dependency
compilation to set up watchers for dependencies so that hot-reload
continues to work due to errors in new depdenencies. Fixes #2147.

* Fix Elm error generation.

I'm not entirely sure why this fix is necessary, but without it a
compile error during a rebuild results in Parcel printing ""Unknown
error"" instead of anything useful. Since we are intecepting the error
though, we can also remove redundant stack information.

* Add test for tracking dependencies on error

* revert hmr-runtime changes

* Transform all errors in Pipeline.process.

This prevents error data from being lost when Pipeline is run via
`WorkerFarm`.

* Separate error-depenency test input from basic Elm tests.

* Update ElmAsset.js",matt.cheely@gmail.com,wbinnssmith@gmail.com,2019-01-03 08:24:22-05:00,2019-04-12 14:04:07-07:00,0.0,0.9454545454545454,1.0,0,1753,1982,0,1534,1693,0,219,289,0,8,68,79,3772,4.6,13.9,1146,0.0

* :white_check_mark: removing redudant test

* :fire: removing irrelevant docs

* :white_check_mark: adding test back in that puts expectations on the image assets generated links + that the content inserted back inbetween the script tag is a valid JSON object (partial credit to @mischnic for simplifying the regex expression with group capturing)

Without this change, you can get malformed stuff like this:

when necessary:

  }
  var bar = function() {

rollup,a9c5850c8552e297945e9ee7f324be17593f14e6,"Avoid lazy parsing by adding parens around factory

Most javascript engines do a lazy parsing optimization. For example if they see:

function X() {...}

They won't parse the contents of X until it is executed. However they often have to read the contents of X so that they can see if X uses any variables from the outer scope. Thus X ends up getting parsed twice.

Realizing that often one immediately executes a function, browser have optimized statements of the form:

(function X() {...})()

So that X is not parsed lazily. Traditionally this optimization looks for an open paren before the function. For example, here's the optimization in v8:

https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/203391bcc0e970d3cae27ba99afd337c1c5f6d42/src/parsing/parser.cc#L4256

Since the factory is immediately executed (at least in the commonJS and global export case), this change avoids the double parsing that comes with parsing the function lazily.",ben.maurer@gmail.com,noreply@github.com,2016-07-07 19:58:34-07:00,2016-07-07 19:58:34-07:00,,,,47,64,266,36,52,196,11,12,70,13.5,1,14,32,1803,4.0,2.3,1508,0.0

Before this change, in plugins like this: 
https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-babel/blob/master/src/index.js#L39
will just get `undefined` in the output.

I haven't have the time to to look very in depth at all the code, but I found a couple of places (both in rollup itself and in external plugins) where the caller is passing a string, so since fixing all the plugins is probably a non-starter, I figure making the API support strings was the easiest.

Most interopts I've seen, babel, webpack, and rollup's [cjs interop](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/src/finalisers/cjs.js#L42) check for the existence of the imported value prior to checking for `default`.

I tried to read the ecma specs but they're pretty confusing.  Is this expected to throw an error?

```js
import foo from 'file-does-not-exist';

// or would it just be undefined?
foo === undefined;
```

Even _if_ it would throw an error in ES2015 modules, if I know my target is UMD anyways, why not allow it to import without an error?",paul@otterball.com,paul@otterball.com,2017-03-18 20:22:21+09:00,2017-03-18 20:22:21+09:00,,,,50,67,182,27,42,149,23,25,33,24,22,27,37,2726,3.0,3.0,2747,0.0
