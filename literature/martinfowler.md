# Summary of Technical debt by Martin Fowler

## Introduction

The basic problem about tech debt is, that you cannot figurre iout productivity. So the cost of interest is unknown upfront, as well as the cost of paying the debt off.  
Removal of technical debt should happen step by step and first in areas, which are frequently edited. Interest rates are only happening, when I have to edit an area of the codebase with debt. As long as I do not have to work on it accumulate only debt and no interest.  
Often the impact of debt is neglected, event though a bad analysis impacts a project quite soon.

## Technical Debt Quadrant

### Reckless vs Prudent

**Reckless**: A reckless debt is e.g. a messy codebase, or missing documentation etc.
**Prudent**: A prudent debt is decided to pay off later on.

### Deliberate vs Inadvertent

**Deliberate**: A concious choice to accumulate the debt as the implications are known
**Inadvertent**: An unknown accumuliation of debt due to not knowing better how to do it.

# Notes to take with

- Remove debt step by step
- Categorize debt in the quadrant hepls adressing it
- Often the impact of debt is marginalized
