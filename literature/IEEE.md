## Introduction

The authors conotate the beginnign of tehcnical debt with Ward Cunningham and make note of important attributions by Steve McConnell for taxonomy, Martin Fowler for his quadrants and Jim Highsmith with the impact on total cost of ownership. They state that the metaphor dilluted from the beginning of "not quite right code, which we postpone making it right" to a broader term claimed by many. Additionally they claim many tools equate there analysis of code as debt, what leaves out other problems.

## The Landscape of technical debt

The paper splits tech debt up in to two major regions:

- Evolution issues
- Quality issues

On the far outliers there are visible indicators of problems. Tech debt is the invisible area in between, which iconsist of a multitude of problems

## Tackling

1. Identifying debt and its causes
2. Manage this debt explicitly
3. Do not solely rely on static code analysis

## A Unified theory

To get to a universal understanding and valuation of debt it might be helpful to pay closer attention to the financial aspects, as such

- Net Present Value
- Opportunity Cost
- Real Option Analysis
- Total Cost of Ownership

# Notes to take with

Important to also evaluate economical factors and divide between evoloution issues and quality issues. Identifying and explicitly managing debt is very important, and should not be satisified by only using static code analysis.
