## Introduction

While the agile way of development spreads around the world techniques to moange technical debt have not emerged in the same way. STill the metaphor conveys a few central points:

- Optimization problem
- Perception of success
- Actively make development decisions

Questions, which still arise:

- Isn't there maybe a better metaphor?
- Can the debt metaphor help in analyzing a software?
- How can debt be identified?
- What kind of debts exist?
- How does the debt relate to evolution and maintenance?
- How to empirically collect data about debt?
- How can debt be analyzed and visualized?

## The technical debt metaphor

Debt can be theorized as the gap between the current and an ideal state of a software.

### Properties of technical debt

- **Visibility**: Technical Debt often poses a problem, when it is not known
- **Value**: Debt should be used to generate value in the long term
- **Present value**: Debt should also incur value now
- **Debt acreation**: Debt might be cumulative
- **Environment**: Debt is relative
- **Origin of debt**: There is a distinction between strategic debt and occurring debt
- **Impact of debt**: How sacattered is the debt?

## Open research questions

- Finding Refactoring opportunities
- Identifying Archtitectural issues
- Identifiying dominant sources of debt
- Measurement issues
- Non-code artifacts
- Monitoring
- Process issues

# Notes to take with

Debt is specific to an environment and gives a shot perception of success
